#PLH-417 EX. 3

# Getting Started

This is a python-3 implemantation of the classical AI problem of Missionaries And Cannibals

# Requirements

You only need Python 3

# How To Run

Simply run:
python MisAndCan.py

# Results

The two shores are divided by the symbol --> 🌊🌊🌊
The symbol --> ➕ --> followed by a number,indicates the number of missionaries, on each shore
The symbol --> 🍖 --> followed by a number,indicates the number of cannibals , on each shore
The symbol --> ⛵ --> can be either 1 or 0 , respectvely, indicating whether the boat is in this shore or not

The total number of correct moves and running time are also printed.

P.S. In case the symbols are not showing , the first one indicates "missionaries" followed by the number , the second "cannibals" followed by the number , the third one "boat" followed by the number, then there is the sea , and then it is the same sequence again.
